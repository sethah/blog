The first week of my Zipfian ("Zip"-"fee"-"in") experience is in the books! I have to say that it is a huge relief just to start the program and validate the decision to leave a good job for a three month bootcamp. I can confirm that Zipfian *is real* and all signs point to this being a great decision. 

I'll try spend more time discussing the content of the program than the logisitics, but I'd like to touch on them a bit. The program is now run out of the [galvanize](http://www.galvanize.it/) collaborative workspace near 2nd street and Market. The building is excellent (though still under construction) and is full of people from other bootcamps, startup companies, and the like. It is not only a great place to work, but a good place to make contacts and network with people in the industry. 

The group of people in this cohort is diverse and well-credentialed. Nearly all of the cohort comes from a STEM background and we all have varying degrees of experience with the data science tools we are learning. As Zipfian continues to improve its reputation, the level of talent it attracts is sure to go up as well. There are a lot of very smart and talented individuals in this cohort, but everyone seems to have meshed together well - for the first week anyway!

The content and structure of the program has been mostly what I expected so far, but even at this early stage there have been a few surprises that I would like to discuss.

##Pair Programming
I knew that I would spend a lot of time doing [pair programming](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) in the program, but I did not really understand what it was. For anyone who doesn't know, pair programming involves coding with a partner where one person "drives" (does the actual coding) and the other person "observes." 

Pair programming is both enlightening and maddening. As the observer, you may want to tackle a problem a certain way, but the driver may have a differing view or methodology that he/she is implementing. It can be very difficult to integrate two coding styles and/or methodologies when only one person has control. At Zipfian, each of the pair has the ability to control the workstation with his/her own mouse and keyboard, so there is a temptation to "take control."

On the contrary, it is very beneficial to understand how different people tackle different problems. You may learn new functions and shortcuts, or entirely new ways of implementing a solution that you had never thought of. Additionally, pairing with a new person every day is a great way to ensure that you get to know everyone in the class.

##SQL
Before the program, I avoided SQL at all costs as I found it to be clunky and unintuitive. One of the big surprises for me in the first week, however, was to find that SQL is a *must-have* in the data science industry. Basically, most companies will not even talk to you if you aren't at least competent with SQL.

As a python user, I found a python library that serves as an abstraction to SQL called [SQL-alchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) which makes query writing and data wrangling more intuitive while still using SQL as the workhorse.  While SQL-alchemy is a great tool, knowing SQL is simply imperative and so, in retrospect, I would have done my data handling using direct SQL queries. Even using the SQL-alchemy wrapper to SQL, it is difficult to understand without having a solid foundation in SQL itself.

SQL can be a very frustrating language because it was designed to be highly parallellizable, which means that it doesn't make sense for SQL to perform tasks iteratively. There are some seemingly very simple tasks that can results in very verbose SQL queries. At Zipfian, we have been using postgreSQL, or postgres, but learning any SQL language is a good choice. 

As a result, I plan to use postgres for all my data storage in the final project to make sure I have a good understanding of SQL. 

##Mac, Linux, and the Terminal
This aspect was more a result of the precourse material than the first week, but learning to use the command line terminal has been like seeing the sun shine for the first time - yeah, *that good*. 

I realize, only now, that trying to work on data scraping and data science projects without using the terminal is cumbersome at best and futile at worst. If I had to pick one thing that I wish I had known, it would be that the terminal is incredibly powerful and useful, especially when working with data. 

A mac or a linux installation is the best way to get started working with the terminal. To learn all that the terminal can do, it is helpful to try to do everything with the terminal (e.g. no more navigating directories in a file explorer window, use the terminal instead!).

##The Project
The Zipfian program structure involves a final project, where students scope, execute, and present a project to potential employers. The project technically does not start until the eighth week of the program, but I am learning that it is imperative to be thinking about your project from the get-go. 

It is important to be competent in all the aspects of data science (coding, statistics, linear algebra, machine learning, visualizations, etc...) but employers are really looking to see a demonstration of what you know. They want to see that you can not only analyze the data, but turn your results into something actionable. *This* is why the project is so important.

Students are not expected to begin working on the project ahead of time, but what is really important is to at least make sure the data you plan to use is a.) obtainable and b.) useful. That is, spending some time making sure that you can get the data in a reasonable time frame (requesting it or setting up a scraper) and also making sure that the data can actually tell you something is very important.

###Summary
My goal is to post once a week, but as the program picks up this may prove difficult. Overall, the start to Zipfian could not have gone any better - it is a well-respected program built by great instructors and with a well-connected network. I look forward to learning more about what it means to be a data scientist in the coming weeks and continuing to develop relationships with my instructors and classmates!
